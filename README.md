# SpringServer_01
Trying to create Server-Client TCP/IP chat using Spring Boot

After running this program, write as web address:

http://localhost:5555/

and enjoy it! :)

In latest version, everything should work on heroku server as:

https://serverclienttcpip.herokuapp.com/

But, so far, it doesn't...

If you have any suggestions, don't hesitate to write to me about it :)
